Hey there! Thanks for checking out my project. 

I created this timer to help myself stay focused on tasks and to keep track of  

To run this locally:

1. fork this repository

2. (in terminal) `git clone https://github.com/lukemccrae/routine-timer.git`

3. cd into the directory with `cd routine-timer`

and finally
4. `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Currently working on transitioning from stateful-components to Redux for state manegement.
