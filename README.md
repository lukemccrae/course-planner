Hey there! Thanks for checking out my project. 

I created this tool to help trail runners plan their racing strategy.

To run this locally:

1. clone this repo
2. yarn
3. yarn start

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
